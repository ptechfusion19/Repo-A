Ayesha, we need a new authentication API for our backend system as part of the Backend API Development project. The task is to build a User Authentication API with FastAPI. Create endpoints for user registration (new accounts with email and password), user login (authenticate users and return JWT tokens), and password reset (allow users to reset forgotten passwords). Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication, validate all inputs (email format, password strength, etc.), handle errors properly and return clear error messages, follow RESTful API conventions (POST for registration/login, etc.), add logging for important actions, and test all endpoints before submitting. The API should be ready to integrate with our mobile application. If you have any questions or need clarification, please let me know. Thank you.
